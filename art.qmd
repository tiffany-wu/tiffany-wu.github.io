People often refer to art that is created by coding in the R statistical programming language as "Rtistry" or "aRt". I love merging my love of art with the technical framework of code, and I think the artistic exploration of code can open the door to beautiful, new visualizations (and better coding skills!).

Here you'll find a selection of "aRt" pieces I've created. I've provided code for some of the pieces on my Github page, so feel free to take a look if you're interested!
