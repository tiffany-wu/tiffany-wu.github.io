*"A line is a dot that went for a walk." - Paul Klee*

People often refer to art that is created by coding in the R statistical programming language as "Rtistry" or "aRt". In my free time, I love merging my love of art with the technical framework of code.

Here you'll find a selection of "aRt" pieces I've created. I've provided code for some of the pieces on my Github page, so feel free to take a look if you're interested!
