I am also an IES Causal Inference Predoctoral Fellow and a 2022 APPAM Equity and Diversity Fellow.\nAt the University of Michigan, I work with Dr. Christina Weiland. I am broadly interested in examining education interventions and policies through research-practice partnerships, using causal inference and machine learning methods. I hope to apply this research to inform the development of more effective and equitable education interventions and teaching policies. I worked as a public high school teacher in Chicago and then as a research analyst for an education non-profit prior to starting my PhD. In my free time, I likes to paint, play the piano, and rock climb.\n\n\nM.A. in Psychology | University of Chicago | 2019\nB.S. in Secondary Education & History | Northwestern University | 2015"

    "text": "People have referred to art that is created by coding in the R statistical programming language as “Rtistry” or “aRt”. I love merging my love of art with the technical framework of code, and I think the artistic exploration of code can open the door to beautiful, new visualizations (and better coding skills!).\nHere you’ll find a selection of Rtistry pieces I’ve created. I’ve provided code for some of the piece on my Github page, so feel free to take a look if you’re interested!\n\n\n\nInspired by a map of my mom’s hometown in Chiayi, Taiwan\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by Haku in Sprited Away\n\n\n\n\n\nSome soot sprites\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by Ponyo\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Spirited Away-inspired aRt"
