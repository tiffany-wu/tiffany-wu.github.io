(2023). Teacher well-being and professional development in a pandemic: Evidence from early educators in the Boston Public Schools. Boston Early Childhood Research Practice Partnership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\nThis brief is part of a larger body of research examining the Boston Universal Pre-K (UPK) expansion and the Expanding Children’s Early Learning (ExCEL) P-3 Project focused on sustaining children’s early learning gains. As we navigate the repercussions of the ongoing pandemic, there is a growing need to understand how districts can better support early educators in their classrooms. Using survey data from Pre-K and third grade teachers in the Boston Public Schools, we provide a descriptive analysis of the professional development supports early educators received from the district in spring 2021. Our findings offer lessons for districts on how investments in professional development supports can strengthen early learning instruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat sustains the pre-K boost? New evidence from Boston Public Schools\n\nWu, T., McCormick, M., Weiland, C., Hsueh, J., Sachs, J., & Snow, C. (2023). What sustains the pre-K boost? New evidence from Boston Public Schools. Boston Early Childhood Research Practice Partnership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren who attend a prekindergarten (Pre-K) program generally score higher on academic, social-emotional, and cognitive assessments at the start of kindergarten than children who do not. However, Pre-K nonattenders typically catch up to Pre-K attenders—sometimes partially and sometimes fully—by the end of kindergarten or first grade. Pre-K attenders still tend to outperform nonattenders in longer-term outcomes such as high school graduation, college attendance, and health status. But with the majority of American children scoring below proficiency in critical reading and math skills in elementary school, there has been considerable research and policy attention paid in recent years to what factors best sustain the Pre-K boost in the elementary school years. Drawing on four papers that use data from students enrolled in the Boston Public Schools (BPS), this brief explores evidence from testing three interconnected theories on how to sustain Pre-K benefits: skill type, sustaining environments, and instructional (mis)alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if You Miss the First Year of an Aligned Curriculum? Boston Public Schools’ Pre-K Non-Attenders Made Equivalent Learning Gains Whether or Not their Kindergarten Program was Aligned with Pre-K\n\nWu, T., Weiland, C., McCormick, M., Sachs, J., Taylor, A., Hsueh, J., & Snow, C. (2023). What if You Miss the First Year of an Aligned Curriculum? Boston Public Schools’ Pre-K Non-Attenders Made Equivalent Learning Gains Whether or Not their Kindergarten Program was Aligned with Pre-K. Boston Early Childhood Research Practice Partnership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAligning Pre-K and kindergarten may be an important strategy for sustaining the Pre-K boost. However, it is possible that efforts to align kindergarten with Pre-K might disadvantage students who did not attend the aligned Pre-K year.\nWe used data from 290 students who did not attend Boston Public Schools’ (BPS) Pre-K program (Pre-K non-attenders) and then enrolled in public kindergarten that was either aligned or unaligned with the Pre-K curriculum.\nWe found that BPS Pre-K non-attenders made equivalent gains in their math, language, literacy, and executive function skills regardless of whether or not they attended an aligned kindergarten program.\nWhile attending both an aligned Pre-K and kindergarten is ideal for helping students smoothly transition from one grade to the next, our descriptive findings suggest that efforts to sustain the Pre-K boost for those who attend do not systematically disadvantage Pre-K nonattenders."
