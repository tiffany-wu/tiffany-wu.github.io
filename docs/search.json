Leveraging Modern Machine Learning to Improve Early Warning Systems and Reduce Chronic Absenteeism in Early Childhood. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis. (also an EdWorkingPaper, No. 24-1081. Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University). link here\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis study focuses on improving the predictive power of early warning systems (EWSs) to decrease chronic absenteeism in early childhood. Using a demographically diverse sample of students followed from PreK to third grade in Boston Public Schools (N=6,698), we demonstrate how and why two modern machine learning algorithms—the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—can enhance EWS accuracy. The best-performing XGBoost model with SMOTE achieved a 54-percentage point improvement in accuracy (in terms of recall rate) over the logistic regression model closest to those used in current EWSs, more accurately detecting students who would become chronically absent in third grade, and outperformed other machine learning approaches evaluated. Notably, models excluding student demographic information maintained comparable predictive accuracy.\n\n\nWu, T., Weiland, C., McCormick, M., C., Hsueh, J., Snow, C., & Sachs, J. (2024).

Assessment, 1-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hearts and Flowers (H&F) task is a computerized executive functioning (EF) assessment that has been used to measure EF from early childhood to adulthood. It provides data on accuracy and reaction time (RT) across three different task blocks (hearts, flowers, and mixed). However, there is a lack of consensus in the field on how to score the task that makes it difficult to interpret findings across studies. The current study, which includes a demographically diverse population of kindergarteners from Boston Public Schools (N= 946), compares the predictive and concurrent validity of 30 ways of scoring H&F, each with a different combination of accuracy, RT, and task block(s). Our exploratory results provide evidence supporting the use of a two-vector average score based on Zelazo et al.’s approach of adding accuracy and RT scores together only after individuals pass a certain accuracy threshold. Findings have implications for scoring future tablet-based developmental assessments.\n\n\n\nMcCormick, M., Hanno, E., Weiland, C., Wu, T., Pralica, M., Hsueh, J., Giles, A., Snow, C., & Sachs, J.

Associations between PreK enrollment and language and math skills were sustained through first grade. More convergence between PreK enrollees and non-enrollees in language skills occurred during first grade than kindergarten. Convergence patterns were stronger in math during kindergarten than in first grade. There were no associations between PreK enrollment and executive functioning by spring of first grade; most convergence occurred in first grade. All other associations were null by first grade."
