    "text": "People often refer to art that is created by coding in the R statistical programming language as “Rtistry” or “aRt”. I love merging my love of art with the technical framework of code, and I think the artistic exploration of code can open the door to beautiful, new visualizations (and better coding skills!).\nHere you’ll find a selection of Rtistry pieces I’ve created. I’ve provided code for some of the pieces on my Github page, so feel free to take a look if you’re interested!\n\n\n\nInspired by a map of my mom’s hometown in Chiayi, Taiwan\n\n\n \n\n\n\nInspired by Haku in Sprited Away\n\n\n\n\n\nSome soot sprites\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by Ponyo\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Spirited Away-inspired aRt"

    "text": "Welcome! I am a doctoral student in the Combined Program in Education and Psychology (CPEP) at the University of Michigan and am pursuing a dual master's degree in Statistics. I am also an IES Causal Inference Predoctoral Fellow and a 2022 APPAM Equity and Diversity Fellow.\nAt the University of Michigan, I work with Dr. Christina Weiland. I am interested in using causal inference and machine learning methods to help inform the development of more effective and equitable education interventions and teaching policies. I am also interested in collaborating as part of research-practice partnerships to make research more publicly accessible and able to guide real-world decision-making. My research is deeply influenced by my previous work as a public high school teacher on the South Side of Chicago and then as a research analyst for an education non-profit prior to starting my PhD. In my free time, I like to paint, play the piano, and rock climb.\n\n\nPhD in Education & Psychology | University of Michigan | Expected 2026\nMA in Statistics | University of Michigan | Expected 2026\nMA in Psychology | University of Chicago | 2019\nBS in Secondary Education & History | Northwestern University | 2015"
