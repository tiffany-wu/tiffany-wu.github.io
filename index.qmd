<section class="about">

Welcome!

**I am on the 2025-2026 job market and available for interviews.**

I am a doctoral student in the [Combined Program in Education and Psychology (CPEP)](https://soe.umich.edu/academics-admissions/cpep) at the University of Michigan and am pursuing a dual master's degree in [Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/dualmasters.html). I am also an [IES Causal Inference Predoctoral Fellow](https://edpolicy.umich.edu/training/predoctoral-fellowship).

At the University of Michigan, I work with [Dr. Christina Weiland](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/christina-weiland/). I am interested in using machine learning, computational social science, causal inference, and psychometric methods to help inform the development of effective education tools, interventions, and policies. I am also interested in collaborating as part of research-practice partnerships to make research more publicly accessible and able to guide real-world decision-making. My research is deeply influenced by my previous work as a public high school teacher in Chicago and then as a research analyst for an education non-profit prior to starting my PhD. In my free time, I like to paint, play the piano, and play pickleball.
