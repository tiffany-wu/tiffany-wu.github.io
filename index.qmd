<section class="about">

Welcome! I am a doctoral student in the [Combined Program in Education and Psychology (CPEP)](https://soe.umich.edu/academics-admissions/cpep) at the University of Michigan and am pursuing a dual master\'s degree in [Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats/masters_students/mastersprograms/dualmasters.html). I am also an [IES Causal Inference Predoctoral Fellow](https://edpolicy.umich.edu/training/predoctoral-fellowship) and a 2022 APPAM Equity and Diversity Fellow.

At the University of Michigan, I work with [Dr. Christina Weiland](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/christina-weiland/). I am broadly interested in examining education interventions and policies through research-practice partnerships, using causal inference and machine learning methods. I hope to apply this research to inform the development of more effective and equitable education interventions and teaching policies. I worked as a public high school teacher in Chicago and then as a research analyst for an education non-profit prior to starting my PhD. In my free time, I likes to paint, play the piano, and rock climb.
